# ISF software intro

Here is information on watching changes on shared ISF developments.

The most important is probably the ISFS project configuration repository,
since we have shared locations in /net/isf/isfs/projects and
/h/eol/isfs/isfs/projects which are modified by many people.

Visit the [github project](https://github.com/ncareol/public-field-projects/)
to see the latest activity, or subscribe to fisheye emails.

There are JIRA projects for ISS, ISFS, and ASPEN.  However, ACS uses github
issues instead, so if you want to follow ACS development, you may want to
subscribe to github notifications for the [ACS project on
github](https://github.com/NCAR/ACS/), or visit the [ACS issues
page](https://github.com/NCAR/ACS/issues).  For example, from the ACS issues
page, you can add 'netcdf' to the filter to see all the open issues which
mention 'netcdf'.  Remove the `is:open` tag to get a pretty good idea of
what's been worked on related to netcdf files across all ACS development.

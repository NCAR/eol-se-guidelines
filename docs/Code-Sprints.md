# Code Sprints

Code sprints have been used by many open-source projects and have evolved
along with the agile development methods.

Here are a few noteworthy points learned from the Aeros Qt4 porting sprint:

- There is a significant effort to setting up infrastructure before the
  sprint, such as making sure everyone has a current, working, building source
  code checkout, with all of the requisite library dependencies installed.
- It takes longer than you think it will.
- There is a benefit to being removed from distractions and working
  collaboratively in a concentrated group.
- It may help to make more people aware of the sprint, since more people have
  a stake in the outcome than participate in the sprint.
- It is invaluable to have test suites in place before the sprint which
  already pass. The tests help verify that the changes have not broken
  anything that was working before the sprint. The more automated,
  comprehensive, and convenient the tests are, the more effective they are.

## Staying Informed

Continuing education is important to maintain one's skills, so much so that
it's mentioned in the ACM Code of Ethics. Finding better ways to develop
software, whether techniques/processes or tools/technologies, is beneficial to
the organization. In addition, continual learning is beneficial to one's
personal state of mind. Conferences (what is EOL/CDS policy on attendance?),
courses, and user groups provide good social exposure. Online resources often
provide the most currency. Reading code is a useful and important way to
improve skills, as is reading books (and reading books about reading code).

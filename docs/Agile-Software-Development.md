[Agile software
development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) is a
family of development processes based on a set of principles which align well
with existing practice and culture in EOL.

Our software development projects, particularly those that emphasize iteration
and evolving scientific requirements and instrumentation, may benefit from
adopting aspects of the agile software development methods. As examples,
releasing working software early and throughout the development process allows
users and domain experts to give continuous, valuable, and relevant feedback.
This encourages the exchange of new ideas, a cooperative and interactive
software development environment, and should result in the creation of
valuable and useful software. Test-driven development emphasizes writing tests
first, which helps to clarify purpose and verify that software works as
expected.

Agile software development is a people-oriented, collaborative development
approach with the flexibility to respond quickly to changes. The Agile
methodology family includes techniques such as Extreme Programming (XP), SCRUM
(project management framework), LEAN, Feature-Driven development (FDD), Test-
Driven development (TDD), and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM). There
are many options and no specific engineering practices are prescribed.

Agile Software Development process ideas are based on the Agile Manifesto and
its associated basic principles
([www.agilemanifesto.org](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)).

# Intro to EOL Software Development

## First things first

Welcome to EOL!

Important first tasks:

- Tour the offices and labs and meet coworkers.
- Discuss schedules and contact preferences, and for interns primarily, how
  often to meet, with whom, and how.
- Get your access badge.
- Find out your phone extension.
- Get access to resources you'll need:
  - [EOL Software Engineering wiki](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/SEW/)
  - [NCAR org on github](https://github.com/NCAR)
  - [ncareol org on github](https://github.com/ncareol)
  - [slack](https://ncar.slack.com)
  - [eol-prog group](https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/g/eol-prog/)
  - [JIRA](https://jira.ucar.edu/)

## Wiki access

At the moment, access to the EOL Software Engineering Wiki (SEW) is restricted,
but new users cannot be added to the wiki until they have an account in Confluence.

- Visit the [wiki main page](https://wiki.ucar.edu/).
- Click Login in the upper right.
- Login with UCAR CIT credentials.

After logging in once, send your username to someone with admin permissions in
SEW.  Most SEs and SAs have permission to add users.

Once you have permission to access the wiki, visit the [SEW front
page](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/SEW/).  Read the
[Introduction](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/SEW/Introduction).  Click the
`Watch` link in the upper right to subscribe to email notifications when
changes are published to the wiki.

## Github access

We have two organizations on github: [NCAR](https://github.com/NCAR) and
[ncareol](https://github.com/ncareol).  Some of our software is still in the
ncareol org, either because it predates the NCAR org and just hasn't been
moved, or because it requires features like git lfs which the NCAR org does
not provide.

You can add an existing github account username to the github organizations,
or if you like you can create a different github account just for your work.

To be added to the NCAR org, see the instructions on the [Git wiki
page](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/SEW/Git).  Searching for `github` on the
UCAR wiki also yields lots of references.

To be added to the ncareol org, provide your github username to someone with
admin permissions in that org.

Once added to an organization, you will probably need to be given read and
write access to relevant private repositories.  You can also be added to
certain teams (groups) to get access to multiplate related repositories at
once.

## Commit emails

It is very useful and almost expected that everyone subscribes to some kind of
notification or email when commits are pushed to github for collaborative
developments.  The
[FishEyeSubscriptions](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/SEW/FishEyeSubscriptions)
wiki page has instructions for subscribing to FishEye notifications.

## eol-prog

There is a google group called
[eol-prog](https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/g/eol-prog).  Join the group
to be on the email list for occasional software-related announcements and
discussions, and to be on the invite list for informal meetings and talks.
The group is open to anyone, not limited by job title.

It looks like only group owners can add members, which means asking one of the
EOL system administrators, or finding a link which requests to be added.

## Issue tracking

Some projects use JIRA to track tasks and issues, since it pre-dates github
issues and often project tasks may not be tied to a single source repository.
See the [JIRA Notes](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/SEW/JIRA+Notes) wiki page
for tips on using JIRA.  Other projects use github issues.

JIRA also uses groups to assign different kinds of permission for different
projects.  Ask another SE about getting permissions on a specific project.

Any new projects should plan to use one or the other, most new projects will
probably want to use github.

## Wiki field logbooks

Some platforms use the [Confluence wiki](https://wiki.ucar.edu/) to host wiki
spaces for the platform itself and for each field project.  The field project
wiki space is a repository for field logs (plosted as dated blog entries) and
project-specific information and events.

You may need to ask to be given permission to access these other field project
logbooks, especially if you need write access.  For ISF staff, there is a
groupd called `sew-group-isf-staff` managed as part of the SEW wiki.  So
someone with admin permissions in the SEW wiki can add you to that group, and
that should allow access to most of the ISF wiki spaces.  Recent examples of
ISF field logbooks are for [ISFS at SOS](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/sos/),
[ISFS at M2HATS](https://wiki.ucar.edu/x/1wTPHg), and [ISS at
M2HATS](https://wiki.ucar.edu/x/SATPHg).

You can subscribe to project field log wikis and receive notification emails
when anything changes, same as for the SEW wiki.  Click the "Watch" menu in
the upper right.  That is often a good way to stay informed of what is
happening during a project.

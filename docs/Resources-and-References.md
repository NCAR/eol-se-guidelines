STAYING INFORMED Continuing education is important to maintain one's skills,
so much so that it's mentioned in the ACM Code of Ethics. Finding better ways
to develop software, whether techniques/processes or tools/technologies, is
beneficial to the organization. In addition, continual learning is beneficial
to one's personal state of mind. Conferences (what is EOL/CDS policy on
attendance?), courses, and user groups provide good social exposure. Online
resources often provide the most currency. Reading code is a useful and
important way to improve skills, as is reading books (and reading books about
reading code).
